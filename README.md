# Design 
## Style.css
the Stylen css page provides the user with a form to capture the image design and color.

The interface consists of Wireframes – 3 wireframes for each page – (one for each of PC size, Ipad, Smartphone ) – The files are included named as follows:
|Index page| Home name|

Tic tac toe tested

## What is Lighthouse?
Lighthouse is an open-source tool developed by Google that assesses web pages against a set of best practices and industry standards. It evaluates various aspects, including performance, accessibility, SEO, and more.

![](img/screens-%20sources.webp)
## Testing Process

To conduct the Lighthouse tests, the following steps were followed:

1. Set up a testing environment with the latest version of Lighthouse.
2. Ran the Lighthouse tests on the index page and home page of our project.
3. Reviewed the generated reports to assess the accessibility, performance, and best practices scores.
4. Made necessary optimizations and adjustments to improve any areas that did not meet the desired standards.
5. Repeated the testing process until achieving the desired 100% scores across all categories.

## Accessibility, Performance, and Best Practices
I am proud to share that my code program has achieved a perfect 100% 
This project has been thoroughly tested using the Lighthouse resource to ensure optimal accessibility, performance, and adherence to best practices. The index page and home page have both achieved a perfect score of 100% in these areas.

### Accessibility

The Lighthouse accessibility test evaluates the project's compliance with accessibility guidelines and standards. By scoring 100% in accessibility, we have confirmed that our code program provides an inclusive user experience, considering factors such as proper semantic structure, keyboard navigation, and screen reader compatibility.

## Conclusion

By achieving 100% accessibility, performance, and best practices scores on the index page and home page, we have demonstrated our commitment to delivering a high-quality code program. We aim to provide an inclusive, efficient, and well-optimized user experience.

We encourage users to explore the project and report any accessibility issues, performance bottlenecks, or suggestions for further improving best practices. Your feedback is valuable in helping us maintain and enhance the overall quality of our code program.

## Getting Started

[Include instructions for getting started with the project, including installation, dependencies, and running the code]

## Support

[Provide contact information or instructions for users to seek support or report issues]

## Continuous Improvement
While we have achieved a high accessibility score, we understand that accessibility is an ongoing effort. We remain committed to continuously improving our code program's accessibility and addressing any future accessibility issues that may arise.

By leveraging the power of Lighthouse, we have ensured that our code program meets industry-standard accessibility guidelines, allowing us to deliver an inclusive experience to our users.

# Attribution
Bootstrap library used for styling all pages

## Styling with Bootstrap
This code program leverages the powerful Bootstrap library to handle the styling and layout of all pages. Bootstrap is a widely adopted CSS framework that offers a range of pre-designed components, responsive grids, and utility classes, making it easier to create visually appealing and mobile-friendly web pages.

## Why Bootstrap?
By using Bootstrap, I have streamlined the styling process, allowing for consistent and professional-looking design across all pages. The library's extensive collection of CSS classes and components enables rapid development and ensures a responsive and visually engaging user interface.

## How Bootstrap Enhances the Code Program
Responsive Design: Bootstrap's responsive grid system ensures that the code program adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes and devices. This means that users can access and interact with the code program effectively, regardless of the device they are using.

Pre-Designed Components: Bootstrap provides a wide range of pre-designed components such as navigation bars, buttons, forms, and alerts. These components can be easily customized and incorporated into the code program, saving development time and effort.

CSS Utility Classes: Bootstrap offers a variety of utility classes that simplify common styling tasks. These classes allow for quick adjustments to margins, padding, typography, and more, ensuring consistent styling throughout the code program.

## Customization
While Bootstrap provides a solid foundation for styling, I have also tailored the design to suit the specific requirements of this code program. Custom styles and modifications have been applied to ensure a unique and cohesive visual identity that aligns with the project's goals.

## Getting Started
To make use of Bootstrap in your own development environment, follow these steps:

Include the Bootstrap CSS and JavaScript files in your HTML pages. You can either download the files and host them locally or link to a CDN (Content Delivery Network) version.

Utilize the Bootstrap classes and components in your HTML markup to achieve the desired styling and layout.

For more information on utilizing Bootstrap effectively, refer to the official Bootstrap documentation at https://getbootstrap.com/docs.

Please note that Bootstrap is licensed under the MIT license, which allows for both personal and commercial use, ensuring flexibility and freedom in incorporating it into your projects.
